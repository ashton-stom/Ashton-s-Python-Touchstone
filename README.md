RUN THIS IN THE COMMAND: python temperature_converter.py

This is my touchstone submission which is a simple temperature unit converter that supports 3 different units (Fahrenheit, Celsius, Kelvin). Acceptable inputs are strings when asked the conversion type, and a float for the value (32, 0, 12.7 etc.) All options will be displayed in console menu with the additional
option to restart with "r" or quit with "q" for convenience. You can also hit "enter" after the conversion is ran to start another.
